## Project Description *(Software Lead)*
This is a program that takes user input (genre(s), ratings, etc.) and using the inputted filters, sends a request to the an API for films that have the attributes given by the user. It displays the movies in a graphical interface and the user is able to click on the "More Info" button to get a detailed description of the movie as well as where to buy, stream, or display if the movie is currently in theaters.

***    

## User Interface Design *(Front End Specialist)*
* << A wireframe or drawing of the user interface concept along with a short description of the interface. You should have one for each screen in your program. >>
    * For example, if your program has a start screen, game screen, and game over screen, you should include a wireframe / screenshot / drawing of each one and a short description of the components
* << You should also have a screenshot of each screen for your final GUI >>

***        

## Program Design *(Backend Specialist)*
* Non-Standard libraries
    * << You should have a list of any additional libraries or modules used (pygame, request) beyond non-standard python. >>
    * For each additional module you should include
        * url for the module documentation
        * a short description of the module
* Class Interface Design
    * << A simple drawing that shows the class relationships in your code (see below for an example). >>
        * ![class diagram](assets/class_diagram.jpg)
    * This does not need to be overly detailed, but should show how your code fits into the Model/View/Controller paradigm.
* Classes
    * << You should have a list of each of your classes with a description. >>

## Project Structure *(Software Lead)*

The Project is broken down into the following file structure:
* main.py
* bin
    * <all of your python files should go here>
* assets
    * <all of your media, i.e. images, font files, etc, should go here)
* etc
    * <This is a catch all folder for things that are not part of your project, but you want to keep with your project. Your demo video should go here.>
